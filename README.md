## WHAT IS BRN.EPAM.COM? 
It is a web-application which is now developed to support people with central auditory skills deficit, with or without hearing loss, users of cochlear implant or hearing aids. It may be taken by children older than 7 years, adults/ elderly subjects, or anyone who wants to improve auditory skills and train the brain to listen better. 
It would contain several series of media exercises (maybe organized like like www.uchi.ru for example).
 
## WHAT CHALLENGES YOU CAN GET IN THIS PROJECT

- Server side: Java/Kotlin + Spring boot (rest api for front)
- DB: Postgres (h2 now is used for development)
- Front-end : up to front-end developers - React or Angular (now Vaadin is used in one branch)

### JIRA
https://jira.epam.com/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=103360&view=planning

---
## For developer's start
1. run command 'gradle assemble' to build project successfully
2. Application.kt - main class to run application from idea directly

## Data base
The project uses postgres 11.5. [Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/index.html)
Currently for local development we use [postgres docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
To install docker:
* [on windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [on mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [oubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
* [centos](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)

To run docker use the following command:

*  on linux:
`docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=brn -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$PG_PASSWORD -e POSTGRES_USER=$PG_USER postgres:11`
* on windows: `?`

_$PG_PASSWORD_ and _$PG_USER_ are environment variables and  could be replaced directly or added to your operation system

### Code style
Please refer for details to kb resources: https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMCOSRINT/Code+style

Always use Ctrl+Alt+L in IDEA to update code formatting before committing!

Use `gradlew ktlint` command to check code style. If this task fails, the related report with error details can
be found in the 'build\reports\ktlint' folder. 
It is also possible to use `gradlew ktlintFormat` command to fix code style errors automatically.
Please note that if `gradlew ktlint` task fails, project build will fail also.
